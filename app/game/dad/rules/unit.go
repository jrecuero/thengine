// Unit structure is the common and generic structure for any unit in the
// application.
//
// A unit or character refers to a single individual, creature, or object that
// participates in the game world.
//
// Players create and control their own characters, which can be any of the
// playable races and classes available in the game. These characters have their
// own set of abilities, skills, hit points, and equipment, and are used to
// navigate the world and interact with other characters, creatures, and objects.
//
// Non-player characters (NPCs) are controlled by the game's Dungeon Master (DM)
// and can be friendly or hostile to the players' characters. NPCs can include
// shopkeepers, quest-givers, villains, and monsters, among others.
//
// In combat, each unit or character takes turns based on their initiative roll,
// with the highest roll going first. During their turn, a character can move a
// certain distance, take actions such as attacking or casting spells, and use
// bonus actions or reactions as appropriate.
//
// Overall, the unit or character is the primary unit of play in D&D,
// representing a unique entity with its own attributes, abilities, and role in
// the game world.
type Unit struct {
	name         string        // unit name.
	description  string        // unit description.

// GetInitiative method return the unit initiative.
//
// Initiative is calculated based on a character's Dexterity modifier. The
// formula for calculating initiative is as follows:
//
// Initiative = d20 roll + Dexterity modifier
//
// At the start of a combat encounter, each participant rolls a d20 (a 20-sided
// die) and adds their Dexterity modifier to the result. The Dexterity modifier
// is determined by the character's Dexterity score and can be found on the
// character sheet.
//
// For example, if a character has a Dexterity score of 16, their Dexterity
// modifier would be +3. If they roll a 12 on their d20 initiative roll, their
// total initiative would be 15 (12 + 3). This would mean that they would act
// in the combat encounter before creatures with lower initiative scores.
func (u *Unit) GetInititive() int {
	// TODO: to be implemented.
	return 1
}

// GetArmorClass method returns the unit armor class.
//
// The Armor Class (AC) in represents a character's ability to dodge attacks
// and avoid taking damage. The formula for calculating AC varies depending on
// the character's equipment and abilities, but generally consists of the
// following components:
//
// Base AC = 10 + Dexterity Modifier + Shield Bonus (if applicable)
//
// Base AC: All characters have a base AC of 10, which can be increased or
// decreased based on other factors.
//
// Dexterity Modifier: The character's Dexterity modifier is determined by
// their Dexterity score and is added to their base AC. A higher Dexterity
// score generally results in a higher AC.
//
// Shield Bonus: If a character is using a shield, the shield bonus is added to
// their AC. This bonus can range from +1 for a light shield to +2 for a heavy
// shield.
//
// Armor Bonus: The bonus provided by a character's armor is added to their AC.
// Different types of armor provide different bonuses, with heavier armor
// providing higher bonuses but also reducing the character's mobility.
//
// Other Bonuses: Certain abilities, spells, and other effects may provide
// additional bonuses to a character's AC. These bonuses should be recorded on
// the character sheet and added to the AC calculation as necessary.
func (u *Unit) GetArmorClass() int {
	// TODO: to be implemented.
	return 1
}

// GetSpeed method returns the unit speed.
//
// A character's speed is the distance they can move in a single round of
// combat or during normal movement. The base speed for most races is 30 feet
// per round, but this can be increased or decreased based on factors such as
// race, class, equipment, and other abilities.
func (u *Unit) GetSpeed() int {
	// TODO: to be implemented.
	return 1
}

// GetProficiencyBonus method returns the unit proficiency bonus.
//
// The proficiency bonus is a bonus to a character's attack rolls, skill checks,
// and saving throws that is determined by the character's level. It starts at
// +2 for 1st level characters and increases by 1 every 4 levels thereafter (to
// a maximum of +6 at level 17).
func (u *Unit) GetProficiencyBonus() int {
	// TODO: To be implemented.
	return 1
}

// GetHitDice method returns the unit hit dice.
//
// The hit dice is a term used to refer to the dice a character rolls to
// determine the amount of hit points they gain when they level up. The type
// and number of hit dice a character has is determined by their class.
// For example, a fighter has 1d10 hit dice, while a wizard has 1d6 hit dice.
// When a character levels up, they roll their hit dice and add their
// Constitution modifier to the result to determine their hit point increase
// for that level.
func (u *Unit) GetHitDice() int {
	// TODO: To be implemented.
	return 1
}
